"Everyone reacted differently to being spoken to in a language they didn't understand.
Katya got quiet and scared.
Ivan leaned forward with an amused expression.
Grisha narrowed his eyes and nodded in a manner suggesting the dawn of comprehension.
Boris, a bearded doctoral student, rifled guiltily through his notes

        "Everyone knows what a curve is, until they have studied enough mathematics to become confused
        through the countless number of possible exceptions."

"I was interviewed in the Israeli Radio for five minutes and 
I said that more than 2000 years ago, Euclid proved that 
there are infinitely many primes. 
Immediately the host interrupted me and asked: 
'Are there still infinitely many primes?'"

"Music is part of Number Theory. 
Nowadays when a number theorist applies for a grant, 
he says that it is good for security, 
but in those days, way before America, 
[they] would say that it's good for music.
I will not comment whether we have progressed..."

<!-- My favorite story along these lines was told to me by a student of David Kazhdan.  -->
"A student [of David Kazhdan] once complained to me that Kazhdan was constantly showing the student a math book and saying 'You see this book? You should know everything in it. But don't read it!' 
This student finally got completely exasperated and asked Kazhdan, 'How am I supposed to know everything in it without reading it?'"

"He wants to create a method of coding, but he doesn't know what to do 
so he makes a random code. Then he is stuck. And then he asks the impossible question, 
'What would the average random code do?' He then proves that the average code 
is arbitrarily good, and that therefore there must be at least one good code. 
Who but a man of infinite courage could have dared to think those thoughts?"
</br>
- Richard Hamming, about Claude Shannon

"The mysteries of mathematics are degraded
if they are made into an object of affirmation and negation,
when in reality they should be an object of contemplation."

    <li>
"In searching out the truth be ready for the unexpected, 
for it is difficult to find and puzzling when you find it."
